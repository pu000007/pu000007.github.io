        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in China, and I have a bachelor's degree in tourism management. After working in the tourism industry for a short period of time, I realized it wasn't the career I wanted to pursue, although I enjoyed traveling. After that, I explored different jobs and had the chance to get to know a lot of cool people.</p>
        <p>And now I am taking my 2<sup>nd</sup> post-secondary program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> that fully aligns with my interests. It's a decision that was based on a lot of exploration and my <em>heart</em>. This program means a lot to me. I wish it could help me land a career that I would enjoy doing for a long time.</p>
